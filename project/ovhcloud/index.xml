My role I am the inventor, I designed the solution and communicated how it works to the team.
Context Designed during development of the Managed Public Registry project. A first implementation of the innovation was open-sourced before submiting the patent to the European commission, so the patent could only be send to the US one.
Note: OVHcloud helped me to write and submit the final patent and we were able to works only with EU and US.</description></item><item><title>Managed Private Registry</title><link>https://holyhope.github.io/project/ovhcloud/managed-private-registry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 10:40:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://holyhope.github.io/project/ovhcloud/managed-private-registry/</guid><description>Managed Public Registry is a product of OVHcloud Public Cloud catalog.
