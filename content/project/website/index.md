The goal is to show an overview of my projects.

## Goal

### Media

Media hosted on external url are open-licensed.

My own media are closed-licensed and not reusable.
These are stored under the `static/` folder and are scaled to the right size in order to be optimized for the web.
Optimized files are generated in `static/120x120` *(depending of the output resolution)*.

### Building html

<https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/>

Sources files are converted to a beautiful website thanks to [hugo](https://gohugo.io), [papermod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) and my custom theme.
